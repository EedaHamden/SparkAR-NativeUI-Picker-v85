# SparkAR-NativeUI-Picker-v85

⚠️ DISABLE COMPRESSION ON ALL TEXTURES THAT YOU USE FOR NATIVEUI BUTTONS ⚠️

⚠️ MAKE SURE THE NATIVEUI PICKER IS ENABLED IN YOUR PROJECT CAPABILITIES ⚠️

This is meant to be a boilerplate for new users or non-scripters to start using Spark AR's NativeUI Picker for their Instagram effects. It takes into account the changes to Spark AR v85+ API and uses Promises to load assets. It is not meant to be a comprehensive exploration into ES6, Spark AR, or writing performant code. This is meant to educate and - hopefully - inspire others to continue learning about how to leverage scripting in their effects.
